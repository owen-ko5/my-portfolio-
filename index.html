                <h1>Game Developer</h1>
                <h3>Developed global games such as :</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Drive-by
                            <p>An awsome car game that revolves around Africa. In collaboration with google maps i was able to develop a game that can assist drivers what to know what to expext on the road as the road in the game are perfect as they are in our google maps.
                                This means that if a driver who plays the game goes to a  new area he will already know how to navigate the roads since they are perfectly as they are in the game. This personally is good as it prevents drivers from having to use their phones as they drive.
                                The game even goes further to include road signs where there need be in real life therefore helping the driver know where there are blindspots and even avoid accidents.
